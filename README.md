# KGANSynergy
This is the implementation code of KGANSynergy, a novel end-to-end Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Drug Synergy (KGANSynergy), which utilizes neighbor information of known drugs/cell lines effectively. KGANSynergy uses knowledge graph (KG) hierarchical propagation to find multi-source neighbor nodes for drugs and cell lines. The knowledge graph attention network is designed to distinguish the importance of neighbors in a KG through a multi-attention mechanism and then aggregate the entityâ€™s neighbor node information to enrich the entity. Finally, the learned drug and cell line embeddings can be utilized to predict the synergy of drug combinations.

Architecture of KGANSynergy. A and B: Embedding layer. A. Drug--drug--cell line combination matrix, where label 1 represents synergy, and label 0 represents antagonism. B. KGs containing drugs, cell lines, tissues and proteins. \hl{The symbol $e$ represents the initial entity associated with the drug/cell line entity, which is the set of tail entities directly related to the drug/cell line.} \textbf{C.} KG propagation layer. Hierarchical propagation is utilized to identify the set of drug/cell line entity neighbor nodes. D. KG attention layer. The figure shows a multi-head attention network that acts on each knowledge propagation process. D (1). The multi-head attention part of the KG. $\left\{t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{n}\right\}$ is the set of $n$ neighboring nodes to entity h in this layer. Arrows with different colors represent multiple attention learning using the triple $(h,r,t)$, which is composed of entity h and each neighbor in the neighborhood set. The multiple learned embedding representations are concatenated/averaged to generate the final neighborhood set embedding representation $e_{N_{h}}^{l}$. D (2). \hl{Using the Bi-Interaction aggregator, the $l$-th layer entity $h$ is aggregated with the neighbor node embedding $e_{N_{h}}^{l}$ acquired in the preceding step}, and finally obtain the $l$-th layer entity $h$ to represent $e_{d}^{l}$ or $e_{k}^{l}$. \textbf{E.} Each layer of node embedding learned by the drug/cell line is aggregated to obtain the drug/cell line's final embedding representation. \textbf{F.} Prediction layer. The probability of synergy between the drug pair on a particular cell line is outputted.
