# KGANSynergy
This is the implementation code of KGANSynergy, a novel end-to-end Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Drug Synergy (KGANSynergy), which utilizes neighbor information of known drugs/cell lines effectively. KGANSynergy uses knowledge graph (KG) hierarchical propagation to find multi-source neighbor nodes for drugs and cell lines. The knowledge graph attention network is designed to distinguish the importance of neighbors in a KG through a multi-attention mechanism and then aggregate the entityâ€™s neighbor node information to enrich the entity. Finally, the learned drug and cell line embeddings can be utilized to predict the synergy of drug combinations.
